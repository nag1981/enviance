Database

The exercise was written using a Oracle 12c database on the back-end. The directory "database" contains a SQL file named 'login_user_create_script.sql' for creating and populating the login_user table.

The exercise uses a datasource named 'log_signin' which is defined near the top of the Application.cfc.

Workflow

A "Logout" button also appears. When the "Logout" button is clicked the ColdFusion session is terminated and the login form reappears.

No Page Refresh
